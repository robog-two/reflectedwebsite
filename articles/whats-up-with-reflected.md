# What's Up With Reflected

Recently, there's been very little releases on Reflected Network, and I think there will continue to be few for the coming months. Here's why.

## Minecraft and Scaling

Since day one of CaveCraft (wow, that long ago), I've struggled with scaling Minecraft servers. There are several ways to work around this, BungeeCord, what used to be Purgatory, which under Reflected Network was renamed to ServerDiscovery. I'm not going to go into technical detail on how they work &mdash; but essentially they allow several separate Minecraft servers to connect together.

The main issue is that Minecraft itself is not meant to scale. Not from a technical perspective, but from a business perspective. Minecraft is at this point Microsoft's cash cow, designed only to feed them a constant stream of kid's parent's money. It is not designed to promote Minecraft servers, Minecraft servers are designed to promote it. Building an independent, recognizable brand identity on top of Minecraft is almost impossible.

This has been exaggerated by the fact that to produce the October 24th event, I would have had to complete not only an integration with the overcomplicated Microsoft Account authentication network, but I'd also have to connect Bedrock and Java servers in a stable manner. While both of those tasks are very much possible, Microsoft themselves claim that they are not designed to be available to end users for modding and fiddling with.

The point I'm trying to get at is that I'm working against Microsoft here, and that's hard.

## What Does this Mean for You

I have one or two other ventures, which I think some of you may have caught on to since they're mentioned and integrated with several Reflected Network underlying services. Regardless, they are something that I can easily just un-plug Reflected Network (figuratively) and move all of my development efforts there. However, none of them have the robust codebase and are fully launched.

So, I have decided that Reflected Network will stay up until Christmas 2021, with minimal maintenance and updates. This doesn't mean Reflected Network is over, it just means that it will be ramping down for the time being until and if I can gather the resources and time to resume all of the projects I've been working on for the October event.

So basically, Reflected isn't going anywhere. Not deleted, not updated, any time soon.

Sorry.
