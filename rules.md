## Rule One (ZERO-TOLERANCE)

### No discrimination.

Discrimination of any minority groups, towards any mutable or non-mutable characteristics of any kind, is not tolerated. This rule is ZERO-TOLERANCE, which corresponds with a skip of the punishment grid. You will also be punished for the use of slurs, regardless of whether you are a part of the minority group they target. Since we can't really confirm this, they are just not allowed at all.

## Rule Two (ZERO-TOLERANCE)

### Criminal / TOS Violating Activities

No criminal activities are permitted. This rule is also ZERO-TOLERANCE. "Criminal Activities" are illegal in the United States, specifically in Florida where our headquarters reside. This rule also applies to our Discord, where you will be punished for violating their [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines), and our Minecraft server, where you will be punished for violating their [EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula).

## Rule Three (MAY BE ZERO-TOLERANCE)

### Harmful Content

Content that harms others is not permitted. Content like this could include discussion of suicide, loud or disturbing audio and video such as ear-r\#\#\# or violence, epilepsy-inducing content, sexually explicit content, and content generally targeting people with mental or physical conditions or trauma that make it difficult to view. Remember, everyone has differences, whether small or extreme, and we need to be as inclusive as possible so they can all be a part of our community. Violations of this rule may be considered ZERO-TOLERANCE if they are extreme enough, this is at the discretion of our moderation team.

## Rule Four

### Alternate Accounts

Alternate accounts are not allowed due to their ability to bypass our punishment systems. If you have needs that can be accommodated with alternate accounts, such as DID or plurality, please [contact moderators](#contact) and we will make an exception.

## Rule Five

### Cheating and Exploits

Using modified clients (except for one exception, see below) is not allowed. Exploiting vulnerabilities is also not allowed. If you're confused as to whether something is an exploit or intended behavior, please report it to [our team](#contact) and refrain from using it.

### LabyMod Exception

[LabyMod](https://labymod.net/) is the only allowed client modification, provided you are using the Vanilla-based version, and not the Forge-based version. Lunar Client and Badlion Client ARE NOT ALLOWED because of how they modify hit packets.

## Rule Six

### Spam, Scams,  and Advertising

Chat messages or usage of features that are repetitive, contain little content, or contian unrelated content are not allowed. This also includes content with malicious links, files, advertising, or social engineering techniques to encourage other users of our services to perform actions or visit websites they would otherwise stay away from. This does NOT mean that all links are banned, just that ones that are misleading or only used for advertising are.

# Punishment Grid

After each punishment, your punishment level increases. For ZERO-TOLERANCE infractions, you are automatically punished at Level 3.

Depending on whether the infraction involves a message or an action, the punishment will be a mute or a ban respectively.

| Level 1    | Level 2     | Level 3        |
|:-----------|:------------|:---------------|
| 7 Day Ban  | 30 Day Ban  | Permanent Ban  |
| 7 Day Mute | 30 Day Mute | Permanent Mute |
